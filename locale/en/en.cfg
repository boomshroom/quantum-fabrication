[mod-setting-description]
qf-allow-decrafting=If checked, then putting buildings in Quantum Storage will automatically decraft them into their ingredients
qf-enable-auto-repair=If checked the mod will automatically repair building by using stored repair packs shortly after the combat is over. This setting will not affect reconstruction of destroyed buildings.\nWARNING - this might impact performance late game when you are constantly attacked by biters.
qf-enable-space-transfer=If checked the mod will be fulfilling space platform's requests from the Storage. Requires a rocket silo on the surface; crafts and consumes rocket parts.
qf-direct-mining-puts-in-storage=If checked then directly mining buildings (right clicking them) will send them to the Storage; otherwise they'll be placed in your inventory like expected from vanilla.\nWarning - if checked it breaks the Undo functionality for buildings you mine.
qf-reactor-transfer-multi=Default rates are 4 items / 80 fluid per second.\nFor example, setting this to 10 would make reactors transfer 40 items / 800 fluid per second
qf-reactor-free-transfer=If checked then Dedigitizing reactor will no longer require heating to transfer items / fluids
qf-use-player-inventory=If unchecked then the mod will ignore items inside player's inventory for all purposes (such as construction, fabrication, item requests, etc)
