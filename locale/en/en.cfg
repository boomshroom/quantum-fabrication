qf-allow-decrafting=If checked, then putting buildings in Quantum Storage will automatically decraft them into their ingredients
qf-defabricator-enable=If yes, buildings will be defabricated back to their ingredients
qf-recipe-blacklist=Recipes that will not be considered for automatic fabrication. Type recipe names separated by commas
qf-builder-blacklist=Entities that will not be built from ghosts. Type entity names separated by commas
qf-fabricator-blacklist=Entities that will not be fabricated. Type entity names separated by commas
qf-defabricator-blacklist=Entities that will not be defabricated. Type entity names separated by commas
qf-digitizer-blacklist=Entities that will not be digitized. Type entity names separated by commas
qf-update-rate=Low number = smaller delay between requests, but potentially heavier lag
qf-update-slots=Low number = more entities processed per request, but potentially heavier lag
qf-dedigitizer-enable=Dedigitizer Reactors are fueled with nuclear fuel cells and capable of pulling any item from fabricator's inventory, essentially teleporting items across any distance
