digitizer-chest=Digitizes items and fluids to store them in a bottomless digital inventory\nSend [virtual-signal=signal-L] to set a limit. Digitization will stop when the amount of digitally stored items exceeds the limit
dedigitizer-reactor=Utilizes nuclear energy to bring stored items back to the analog world!\nSend item and/or fluid signal to set filters, quality is selected by sending a quality signal.\nSend [virtual-signal=signal-S] with a surface ID to specify the surface from which to take items. Cross-surface materialization is 5 times more expenive and 2 times slower. Surface's IDs are shown in the Quantum Storage title for that surface

qf-direct-mining-puts-in-storage=Send directly mined buildings to the Storage

[mod-setting-description]
qf-allow-decrafting=If checked, then putting buildings in Quantum Storage will automatically decraft them into their ingredients
qf-enable-auto-repair=If checked the mod will automatically repair building by using stored repair packs shortly after the combat is over. This setting will not affect reconstruction of destroyed buildings.\nWARNING - this might impact performance late game when you are constantly attacked by biters.
qf-enable-space-transfer=If checked the mod will be fulfilling space platform's requests from the Storage. Requires a rocket silo on the surface; crafts and consumes rocket parts.
qf-direct-mining-puts-in-storage=If checked then directly mining buildings (right clicking them) will send them to the Storage; otherwise they'll be placed in your inventory like expected from vanilla.\nWarning - if checked it breaks the Undo functionality for buildings you mine.
