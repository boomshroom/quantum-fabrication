Version: 2.0.4
Date: 06.11.2024
  Minor Features:
    - Added an option to specify where you want the mined items to go - to the Storage or to your inventory (this only affects items you directly mine with right click). Sending items to the Storage breaks the Undo functionality so it's off by default, but you can turn it on if you prefer the old behavior.

    - Fixed a bug with batches of buildings not getting defabricated if you lacked materials to fabricate them.
    - Fixed a bug with deconstruction of belts erasing all items they carry.
    - Fixed a bug with fabrication prioritising player's inventory over the Storage.

Version: 2.1.0
Date: 09.11.2024
  Minor Features:
    - Added GUI to Digitizing chests. It can be used to set intake limits, removing the need to fumble with circuits. Existing chests will have their intake limits updated to the currently received signal. It's still possible to set limits via signals, non-zero signals will take precedence over GUI settings.
    - Added GUI to Dedigitizing reactors. It can be used to set filters and select the source surface. Existing reactors will have these settings updated to the currently received signals. It's still possible to manage filters by signals, non-zero signals will take precedence over GUI settings.
    - Updated a technology icon for Matter Digitization (the one that unlocks Digitizing chests) to not be an electronic circuit.

    - Fixed a crash caused by opening GUI before string translation is finished.
